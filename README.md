# Gin for Platform.sh

This template demonstrates building the Gin framework for Platform.sh using Go modules.  It includes a minimalist application skeleton that demonstrates how to connect to a MariaDB server for data storage.  It is intended for you to use as a starting point and modify for your own needs.

Gin is a lightweight web framework written in Go that emphasizes performance.

## Features

* Go 1.14
* MariaDB 10.4
* Git module-based build

## Customizations

This project relies on Go module support in Go 1.11 and later.  You should commit your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files to Git, but not the `vendor` directory.

The following files and additions make the framework work.  If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

* The `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/services.yaml`, and `.platform/routes.yaml` files have been added.  These provide Platform.sh-specific configuration and are present in all projects on Platform.sh.  You may customize them as you see fit.
* An additional Go module, [`platformsh/config-reader-go`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-go), has been added.  It provides convenience wrappers for accessing the Platform.sh environment variables.
